                        <h3>Services Eligibility</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our services allow you to recover lost words of your seed phrase and access your locked funds. The 
                            Services are offered and available only if the user is at least 16 years old and resident 
                            in a country where cryptocurrencies are not illegal. By using the Services, you agree and 
                            warrant to be at least 16 years of age and that you will abide by the conditions mentioned in
                            the Terms of Service. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The site is client-side and we will never hold or store your mnemonic on 
                            our database. You will be able to interact with the Site using the interface 
                            which may be directly interacting with other blockchains. The site is not a guarantee of security 
                            and it is recommended to download our MetaSafe desktop tool.
                            </p>
                            <p>When you access certain features of the Services, you will be able to set your words and the client will attempt to 
                                identify the funds behind every possible seed phrase. We do not store data nor we will track you when such
                                operations happen. MetaSafe does not collect or hold your mnemonic information, 
                                and the operations are entirely client side. For better security, you should download our tool on your desktop and keep 
                                the seed phrase analysis offline. 
                            </p>
                            <p>If you are an Enterprise Client, you may use our tool to recover your seed phrase. 
                                 You must let us know if you're using MetaSafe Service such that we can offer you better advice on how to recover you seed phrase. Using MetaSafe as an enterprise without our 
                                authorization is a breach of agreement. Shall you not respect this 
                                condition you agree that MetaSafe will take you to court in United Kingdom in order to resolve our dispute. 
                            </p>

                                You expressly relieve and release MetaSafe from any and all liability and/or loss arising from your 
                                use of the Services.
